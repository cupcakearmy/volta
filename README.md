## What does it do?

Good question. It gives you notifications about when to plug and unplug your charger. 

> Cool, but why?

Batteries loose the most capacity if the voltage difference is high, or staying at 100%. Hence, if you you use your laptop most of the time plugged in, it will decrease the capacity of the battery quicker than normal.

To sum up, you should **not**:

- Charge you battery **regulary** over 80-90%
- Discharge under 30-40%
